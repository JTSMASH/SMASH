<p> My name is Jaiden Taylor I was born on 10/16/2003. 
I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada and I lived there until I was nine and moved to Georgia.
My dream college is UNLV (University of Nevada Las Vegas) because I hate Georgia and It's Bipolar weather.
I also have a lot of family in both Las Vegas and California not that I care but It's a reason so I'll use it.</p>
